d You lethargically pry yourself away from the computer. "I'll finish it up in the morning before class," you lie to yourself.
d You grab a hoodie and your keys then stumble out the door. The trek across campus is uneventful.
d Your friend hears you knocking and lets you in. It doesn't look like a party. In fact, there's just your friend and the roommate.
d "Yo hommes, whaddup, I thought there was a partay," you manage.
d "Uh, that was last night. What day do you think it is? Were you seriously up all night and all day doing your CMPS 12B homework?"
